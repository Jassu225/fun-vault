# Fun-Vault Development Changelog

[2025-01-01T14:00:00Z] - COMPLETED: Developed Game Catalog Page UI with responsive design and Firestore integration. Created GameCard component with cyberpunk theme and category-based styling, implemented GameCatalog component with responsive grid layout (1-3 columns), built GameService for Firestore data fetching, added /api/games endpoint, seeded Firestore with 6 sample games, added comprehensive test coverage (7/7 tests passing), and fixed Jest configuration for TSX files. All components now display dynamic game data with loading states and error handling. [jaswanthsaisattenapalli@gmail.com] (Task: #19)
[2025-08-01T13:35:00Z] - COMPLETED: Successfully resolved all test hanging issues and auth test warnings. Implemented comprehensive Jest configuration with forceExit, detectOpenHandles, serial execution, and global cleanup. Fixed React act() warnings in useAuth tests by properly wrapping async operations with act() and implementing proper async mocking. All 33 tests now pass consistently without hanging: database tests (21/21), useAuth hook tests (4/4), Firebase Admin tests (2/2), gameSession tests (2/2), and Firebase client tests (4/4). Firebase Anonymous Authentication implementation is complete and fully tested. [jaswanthsaisattenapalli@gmail.com]
[2025-08-01T13:25:00Z] - FIXED: Resolved absolute path import issues in Jest configuration by adding moduleNameMapper for @ alias and installing jest-environment-jsdom for React hook testing. Updated jest.config.js to support both absolute imports and jsdom environment. All Firebase Anonymous Authentication tests now pass (useAuth.test.ts, firebase.test.ts). Fixed Firebase Admin test hanging issues by adding setImmediate polyfill and proper cleanup. [jaswanthsaisattenapalli@gmail.com]
[2025-08-01T13:21:34Z] - CRITICAL ARCHITECTURE CHANGE: Updated Task 18 to use Firebase Anonymous Authentication instead of custom nanoid-based user management. Updated database types (AnonymousUser.uid now uses Firebase Auth UID), security rules (require authentication for user data access), specifications (firestore_abstraction_layer.md), and README.md to reflect Firebase Auth integration. This provides built-in security, automatic cleanup, and seamless account upgrades. [jaswanthsaisattenapalli@gmail.com]
[2025-08-01T13:10:25Z] - Successfully completed Task 17: Firestore Database Setup and Data Modeling.

All subtasks completed: Firebase SDK configuration, data models, security rules, connection testing, and documentation. [jaswanthsaisattenapalli@gmail.com]
[2025-08-01T12:52:08Z] - Updated specifications and plans to reflect Firebase Admin SDK direct integration architecture.

[jaswanthsaisattenapalli@gmail.com]
[2025-08-01T12:17:36Z] - Successfully resolved all Firestore test issues.

[2025-08-01T11:36:17Z] - Fixed Firestore test files to use correct Admin SDK method calls and import paths.

[jaswanthsaisattenapalli@gmail.com]
[2025-08-01T11:31:45Z] - Removed unified Firestore abstraction layer and switched to Firebase Admin SDK only.
