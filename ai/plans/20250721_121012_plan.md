# Execution Plan: Firestore Database Setup and Data Modeling

Task: 17. Firestore Database Setup and Data Modeling
Created: 2025-07-21 12:10:12 UTC
Status: Pending

## Objectives

- Integrate Firestore securely (server-side only) using the Firebase Admin SDK.
- Store all credentials and sensitive config as environment variables.
- Define and initialize all required collections:
  - `games` (metadata)
  - `gameSessions`
  - `anonymousUsers`
  - `gameStatistics`
  - `globalStatistics` (document)
- Implement and test TypeScript data models for all collections.
- Document setup and configuration for future developers.

## Step-by-Step Plan

### 1. Install and Configure Firebase SDK

- Add `firebase-admin` and (if needed) `firebase` as dependencies.
- Set up environment variables for Firebase credentials (service account JSON, project ID, etc.).
- Create a service module (e.g., `src/services/firebaseAdmin.ts`) to initialize and export the Firestore instance for server-side use.
- Ensure the client never directly connects to Firestore; all access is via server-side code.

### 2. Define Firestore Data Models

- Create or update TypeScript types/interfaces for all collections in `src/types/database.ts`.
- Document the schema for each collection, including required fields, types, and relationships.
- Reference the PRD’s Data Architecture section for field definitions and constraints.

### 3. Implement Firestore Security Rules (Optional but recommended)

- Draft and document security rules for all collections.
- Ensure rules are strict: only allow server-side/admin writes, public reads only where appropriate (e.g., `games`).
- Save rules in `firestore.rules` and document them in `/ai/specs/database/`.

### 4. Test Firestore Connection

- Write unit tests for Firestore helper functions (e.g., `createGameSession`, `updateUserStats`).
- Use the Firestore emulator for all tests.
- Ensure tests cover both successful and permission-denied scenarios.
- Manually verify via the Firebase Console that API routes can read/write as expected.

### 5. Document Setup

- Add clear setup instructions to the README or a dedicated setup doc.
- List all required environment variables and configuration steps.
- Include instructions for running the Firestore emulator and tests.
- Document any caveats or gotchas for local development and deployment.

## Testing Strategy

- 100% unit test coverage for all Firestore helper functions.
- Use Jest and the Firestore emulator for all tests.
- Test both happy paths and error/permission-denied cases.
- No direct client-side Firestore access—test only server-side logic.

## Completion Criteria

- All collections and data models are defined and documented.
- Firestore integration is secure and server-only.
- Security rules are enforced and tested.
- All helper functions are fully tested.
- Setup and configuration are clearly documented.
- All changes are logged in `/ai/CHANGELOG.md`.
