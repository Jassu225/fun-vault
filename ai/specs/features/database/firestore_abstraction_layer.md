# Firebase Admin SDK Integration

## Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Reference**: This feature aligns with the Master PRD at `/ai/specs/prd.md`

### Overview

Direct integration of Firebase Admin SDK for server-side Firestore operations, providing secure, scalable database access for the Fun-Vault gaming platform.

### Alignment with Product Vision

This implementation supports the core gaming platform by providing reliable data persistence for games, user sessions, and statistics tracking, enabling the cyberpunk-themed digital arcade experience.

### Business Context

- **Problem**: Need secure, scalable database operations for gaming platform
- **Target users**: Anonymous users and platform administrators
- **Success metrics**: 99.9% uptime, sub-100ms query performance, secure data access
- **Business value**: Enables real-time gaming experiences and analytics

### Core Requirements

#### Must-have features:

- Firebase Admin SDK integration for server-side operations
- Environment-based configuration (emulator vs production)
- Comprehensive CRUD operations for all collections
- Type-safe operations with TypeScript
- Automatic timestamp management
- Error handling and validation

#### Nice-to-have features:

- Connection pooling optimization
- Query caching for frequently accessed data
- Batch operations for performance
- Real-time listeners for live updates

#### Out of scope:

- Client-side Firestore SDK (using Firebase Auth instead)
- Complex aggregation queries
- Multi-region replication

## User Stories

- As a **developer**, I want secure server-side database access so that I can implement game logic safely
- As an **anonymous user**, I want my gaming sessions to be tracked so that I can see my progress
- As a **platform admin**, I want to manage game metadata so that I can control available games
- As a **system**, I want to track statistics so that I can provide analytics and insights

## Acceptance Criteria

- Given a Firebase project is configured, when the application starts, then Firebase Admin SDK initializes correctly
- Given an anonymous user signs in, when they play a game, then their session is recorded with their Firebase Auth UID
- Given a user completes a game, when the session ends, then statistics are updated atomically
- Given the emulator is running, when tests execute, then they use the emulator instead of production

## Technical Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- Initialize Firebase Admin SDK with environment-based configuration
- Provide CRUD operations for all collections (games, gameSessions, anonymousUsers, gameStatistics, globalStatistics)
- Handle anonymous user authentication via Firebase Auth
- Implement atomic operations for statistics updates
- Support both emulator and production environments

### Non-functional Requirements

- Sub-100ms query performance for single document operations
- 99.9% uptime for database operations
- Secure access with proper authentication
- Type-safe operations with comprehensive TypeScript types

### Dependencies

- Firebase Admin SDK (`firebase-admin`)
- Firebase Auth for anonymous user management
- Environment variables for configuration
- TypeScript for type safety

### Performance Criteria

- Database operations complete within 100ms
- Support for concurrent user sessions
- Efficient query patterns for statistics aggregation

## API Endpoints

### Database Service Functions

```typescript
// Games Collection
createGame(game: Omit<Game, 'uid' | 'createdAt' | 'lastUpdatedAt'>): Promise<DocumentReference>
getGame(gameId: string): Promise<DocumentSnapshot<Game>>
getAllGames(): Promise<QuerySnapshot<Game>>
getActiveGames(): Promise<QuerySnapshot<Game>>

// Game Sessions Collection
createGameSession(session: Omit<GameSession, 'uid' | 'createdAt' | 'lastUpdatedAt'>): Promise<DocumentReference>
getGameSession(sessionId: string): Promise<DocumentSnapshot<GameSession>>
updateGameSession(sessionId: string, updates: Partial<GameSession>): Promise<WriteResult>
getUserGameSessions(userId: string): Promise<QuerySnapshot<GameSession>>

// Anonymous Users Collection (Firebase Auth UIDs)
createAnonymousUser(user: Omit<AnonymousUser, 'uid' | 'createdAt'>): Promise<DocumentReference>
getAnonymousUser(userId: string): Promise<DocumentSnapshot<AnonymousUser>>
updateAnonymousUser(userId: string, updates: Partial<AnonymousUser>): Promise<WriteResult>
incrementUserGamesPlayed(userId: string): Promise<WriteResult>

// Game Statistics Collection
createGameStats(stats: Omit<GameStats, 'uid' | 'lastUpdatedAt'>): Promise<DocumentReference>
getGameStats(gameId: string): Promise<DocumentSnapshot<GameStats>>
updateGameStats(gameId: string, updates: Partial<GameStats>): Promise<WriteResult>
getAllGameStats(): Promise<QuerySnapshot<GameStats>>

// Global Statistics Collection
getGlobalStats(): Promise<DocumentSnapshot<GlobalStats>>
updateGlobalStats(updates: Partial<GlobalStats>): Promise<WriteResult>
incrementGlobalStats(fields: Partial<Record<keyof GlobalStats, number>>): Promise<WriteResult>
initializeGlobalStats(): Promise<WriteResult>

// Utility Functions
getDatabaseStats(): Promise<{ totalGames: number; totalSessions: number; totalUsers: number; totalGameStats: number }>
```

## Database Changes

### Schema Updates

- **AnonymousUser.uid**: Now uses Firebase Auth UID instead of custom nanoid
- **GameSession.anonymousUserUid**: References Firebase Auth UID
- All collections maintain existing structure with proper timestamps

### Migration Requirements

- Existing data may need migration if custom UIDs were used
- New anonymous users will use Firebase Auth UIDs
- Security rules updated to work with Firebase Auth

## UI/UX Requirements

- No direct UI changes required (server-side only)
- Client-side will use Firebase Auth for anonymous sign-in
- User experience remains seamless with automatic authentication

## Test Requirements

### Unit Test Scenarios

- Firebase Admin SDK initialization
- CRUD operations for all collections
- Error handling for invalid operations
- Environment-based configuration testing

### Integration Test Cases

- End-to-end game session creation and retrieval
- Statistics updates and aggregation
- Anonymous user management with Firebase Auth

### E2E Test Workflows

- Complete game session lifecycle
- Anonymous user authentication flow
- Statistics tracking and updates

### Coverage Requirements

- 100% coverage for database service functions
- All error paths tested
- Environment-specific behavior verified

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Firebase Auth Integration

- Implement Firebase Auth anonymous sign-in
- Update client-side user management
- Modify database operations to use Firebase Auth UIDs

### Phase 2: Database Service Updates

- Update database service to work with Firebase Auth UIDs
- Modify security rules for Firebase Auth integration
- Update tests to reflect new authentication method

### Phase 3: Testing and Validation

- Comprehensive testing of new authentication flow
- Performance testing with Firebase Auth
- Security validation and penetration testing

## Risks & Mitigations

### Technical Risks

- **Risk**: Firebase Auth rate limits for anonymous sign-ins
- **Mitigation**: Implement proper error handling and retry logic

- **Risk**: Migration complexity from custom UIDs to Firebase Auth UIDs
- **Mitigation**: Gradual migration with backward compatibility

### Timeline Risks

- **Risk**: Firebase Auth integration complexity
- **Mitigation**: Leverage Firebase documentation and community resources

### Mitigation Strategies

- Comprehensive testing before production deployment
- Gradual rollout with monitoring
- Fallback mechanisms for authentication failures
