# Task ID: 16
# Title: Project Scaffolding and Core Architecture Setup
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the Next.js 15 project with TypeScript, configure Tailwind CSS with the specified cyberpunk theme, and establish the foundational project structure for a scalable and maintainable application.
# Details:
Use `create-next-app` to scaffold a new Next.js 15 project with TypeScript. Configure `tailwind.config.js` to include a custom theme with dark backgrounds, neon text, and accent colors as per the design principles. Set up a Vercel project linked to the Git repository for automated CI/CD. Establish a directory structure for `/components`, `/app` (with API routes), `/lib` (for utilities), and `/styles`.

# Test Strategy:
Verify the Next.js application runs locally (`npm run dev`) and deploys successfully to a Vercel preview environment. Confirm that custom Tailwind CSS theme colors and utility classes are correctly applied to a basic placeholder page. The CI/CD pipeline on Vercel should trigger on git push.
