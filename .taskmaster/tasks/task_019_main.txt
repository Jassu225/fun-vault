# Task ID: 19
# Title: Develop Game Catalog Page UI
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 17
# Priority: high
# Description: Build the main landing page that displays the catalog of available games in a responsive, cyberpunk-themed grid layout.
# Details:
Create a server component in Next.js for the homepage that fetches game metadata from the `games` collection in Firestore. For each game, render a 'Game Card' component displaying its name, description, and any available stats. The layout must be fully responsive, adapting from a multi-column grid on desktops to a single column on mobile devices using Tailwind CSS.

# Test Strategy:
Component tests for the 'Game Card'. End-to-end tests to ensure the page correctly fetches and displays data from Firestore. Manually test the page's responsiveness across various screen sizes (e.g., 360px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px).
