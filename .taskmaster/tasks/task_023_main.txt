# Task ID: 23
# Title: Implement Gameplay for Connect 4 and Checkers
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 22
# Priority: medium
# Description: Expand the game library by building the specific game logic and UI components for Connect 4 and Checkers, integrating them with the existing systems.
# Details:
For each game, create a unique game board component and game-specific logic (e.g., gravity for Connect 4, piece movement/capture for Checkers). Reuse the core architecture for state management and AI integration. This task assumes the corresponding AI models are available on Hugging Face.

# Test Strategy:
Perform extensive manual gameplay testing for both games, checking for edge cases (e.g., a full board in Connect 4, kinging a piece in Checkers). Write unit tests for the specific win-condition logic of each game.
