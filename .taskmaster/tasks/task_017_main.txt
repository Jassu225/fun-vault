# Task ID: 17
# Title: Firestore Database Setup and Data Modeling
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 16
# Priority: high
# Description: Configure Firestore integration within the Next.js application and implement the data schemas for all required collections as outlined in the PRD's Data Architecture section.
# Details:
Create a new Google Cloud project with a Firestore database. Set up the Firebase Admin SDK for secure server-side access within Next.js API routes, storing credentials as environment variables. Define and create scripts to initialize the collections: `games` (for metadata), `gameSessions`, `anonymousUsers`, `gameStatistics`, and the `globalStatistics` document.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for database helper functions (e.g., `createGameSession`, `updateUserStats`). Manually verify via the Firebase Console that API routes can successfully write and read data to the respective collections according to the defined schema.
