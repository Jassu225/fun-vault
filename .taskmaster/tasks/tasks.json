Implement a generic game state management system using React's `useReducer` hook to handle the game board, current turn, and game status (in-progress, win, lose, draw).

        "details": "Develop an API route (e.g., `/api/ai/move`) that accepts the current game state from the client. This server-side route will make a secure request to the Hugging Face Inference API, passing the game state to the appropriate custom-trained model. The Hugging Face API key must be stored securely as a server-side environment variable. Implement error handling and a fallback mechanism for API failures.",
